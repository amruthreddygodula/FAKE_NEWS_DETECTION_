# About the Project

This project aims to build a web application that allows users to input news articles and determine if they are real or fake. It uses machine learning techniques and natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the text and make predictions.

# Concepts Included

- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Used for processing and analyzing textual data.
- TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts text data into numerical feature vectors.
- Machine Learning: Trained model for binary classification (real vs. fake news).
- Data Visualization: Visual representation of data for better understanding.
- Word Cloud: Visualization technique to represent the frequency of words in the news articles.
- Streamlit: Framework for creating the interactive web application.

## Features

- Real-Time Prediction: Input news text and get real-time predictions on its authenticity.
- Prediction Confidence: Provides a confidence score (%) for each prediction.
- User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-use web interface for entering text and viewing results.
- Resources Section: Includes useful links for learning about fake news detection and critical thinking.

# Technologies Used

- Python: Programming language used for developing the model and web app.
- Streamlit: Framework for building the web application.
- scikit-learn: Library for machine learning and data processing.
- Pickle: Used for model serialization and deserialization.
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- NumPy: Library for numerical operations.
- Matplotlib: Library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- WordCloud: Library for creating word cloud visualizations.
- Seaborn: Library for statistical data visualization.

# Installation
Ensure you have vscode installed ,including python extension.


# Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Running the page
To start the Streamlit page, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
streamlit run stream.py
```

# Using the page
1. Enter the news text in the text area provided.
2. Click on the 'Predict' button to see if the news is real or fake.
3. The app will display the prediction result and the confidence score.
