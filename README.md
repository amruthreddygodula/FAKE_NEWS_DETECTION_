## About the Project

This project aims to build a web application that allows users to input news articles and determine if they are real or fake. It uses machine learning techniques and natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the text and make predictions.

### Concepts Included

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Used for processing and analyzing textual data.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts text data into numerical feature vectors.
- **Machine Learning**: Trained model for binary classification (real vs. fake news).
- **Streamlit**: Framework for creating the interactive web application.

## Features

- **Real-Time Prediction**: Input news text and get real-time predictions on its authenticity.
- **Prediction Confidence**: Provides a confidence score (%) for each prediction.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use web interface for entering text and viewing results.
- **Resources Section**: Includes useful links for learning about fake news detection and critical thinking.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for developing the model and web app.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for building the web application.
- **Scikit-learn**: Library for machine learning and data processing.
- **Pickle**: Used for model serialization and deserialization.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical operations.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
